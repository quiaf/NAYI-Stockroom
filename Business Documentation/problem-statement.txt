Cellphone accessory retailer, "All Fashion" or AF, with 10 stores in Argentina is in dire need of help.

Last year even though sales have not dropped, the business has been losing money and is about to go under.

AF's main selling product is phone cases. The cases come from multiple brands and each have may many models. 

AF also sells tripods, phone chargers, cables among other types of accessories.

Piero, the owner, buys the products from a whole seller abroad and distributes them to his stores.

Each store has multiple employees but only one store manager who is in charge of sales and stock management for their store.

Managers relay daily to Piero how much they have sold per day as well as if they are running low on stock so he can buy more.

Since sales have not dropped, Piero has been trying to understand why his business is failing. 

He has identified that numbers started to drop when he started expanding and his family stopped helping as store managers. 

Looking at the sell records, he has also noticed that depending on the area, stores have radically different product model surplus.

A model that is popular and runs out quickly in the San Isidro store, may not even sell a unit in the Avellaneda store.

Piero has hired you to figure out what the issue is, then design and implement a simple backend software solution that helps his business stay afloat.
